# Supabase Configuration
# These environment variables are REQUIRED for the application to work correctly.
# The Supabase Edge Functions are used for:
# - Fetching cities dynamically (fetchCities)
# - Fetching hotels by city (fetchHotelsByCity)
# - Search inventory (searchInventory)
# - Booking operations (bookInventory, prebookRoom, initiateCheckout)
#
# To get these values:
# 1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Settings → API
# 3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key
#
# Without these values:
# - Dynamic cities will fail and fallback to static list
# - Hotel search and booking features will not work
